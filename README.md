The file to realize the control of WLAN handoff based on Deep Q-Network.
The WLAN environment is Mininet-WIFI.
Take the SINR values as state and the handoff decisions as actions.

The implementation is in paper "Artificial Intelligence-Based Handoff Management for Dense WLANs: 
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900445
