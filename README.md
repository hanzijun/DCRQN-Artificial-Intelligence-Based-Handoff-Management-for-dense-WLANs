This is the implementation for paper "Artificial Intelligence-Based Handoff Management for Dense WLANs: 
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach", DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900445 

Specifically,
it realizes the control of handoff management in WLAN based on Deep Q-Network.
We model the handoff process as a markov decision process(MDP) in which we take WLAN as the interactive environment,
the SDN controller as the agent, the SINR as real-time state for decisions and the handoff decisions as actions for agent.
